Hello everypne,

I thought I'd give an update on this project. I am extremely new to Github. I've been here for a year
but never really got involved in anything. I'd say I'm pretty decent at Java (my biggest strength is 
that I can problem solve really well, both mathematically and if I run into a tricky situation that I don't
have experience with). Obviously no body ever taught me git or really even about github, and while there
were resources, I was way more involved in how many languages I could learn and how well I could learn them.
What I didn't realize was experience in a single language with work to show for it is much more valuable than
general experience in multiple languages with nothing to show for it. So, as I enter my final semesters of
college before my bachelors, I want to focus on getting my work out there. I'm pretty crapped out on ideas
(Okay, that one was a lie but I need to learn more skills and libraries before I can make an entire beautiful 
app that executes the task I want it to. I'm not a full stacks developer yet. Someday...someday). 

So, what I've been doing is getting some work out there by throwing up a project Euler problem solution every day.
There's around 600 problems available online right now so that gives me a little under two years to move on. I'll
be doing some side projects, websites, apps, and maybe a database, with this so I get some bigger works out there 
as well. 

I've been using codeanywhere.com as well as repl.it to type up code and upload it to Github. Codeanywhere is great
because I had zero knowledge of Git until yesterday, but I am forced to use their SSH terminal to upload to Github
so now I have to learn it. The downside is I'm still very new to this as well and can't even make my java files run
on here yet (they work, but I have to test them in repl.it). I'll figure out why the run button won't work soon.
Memorial Day weekend is coming up and I should have time and be able to play around some more. Anyway, that's
my status update. I'm thinking about starting a blog to post these things to (good way to practice HTML and using
Google Analytics). We'll see how it goes. 

Adios,
